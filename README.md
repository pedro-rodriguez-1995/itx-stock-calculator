<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is created to resolve a programming challenge that states: 

A person receives their payroll on the last Thursday of each month. From the first day that Inditex is listed on the stock market (May 23, 2001), the person has decided to invest each day after receiving its payroll (or if there was no listing that day, the following day there is one), the amount of 50 € in group shares

The purchase of the shares is made at the opening price of that day of purchase. This person uses a broker that allows him to buy partial stocks so that he can always invest the €50, but this broker keeps 2% of the amount invested at the time of purchase.

Calculate what the final capital obtained will be, if you make the total sale of your stocks on December 28, 2017 at the closing price of the listing.
